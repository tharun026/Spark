Innova Solutions:

1. Lineage Graph vs DAG in Spark
RDD Lineage is for a single RDD on how it will be transformed from source to destination. 
DAG is a culmination of RDD's and the actions that will be performed on them

2. Spline in Spark

3. RDD vs DataFrame vs Dataset

4. Parameters for spark submit
executorMemory, driverMemory, executor cores, broadcast threshold, 

5. How Spark works internally

Purchasing Power:

1. Datalake vs Datawarehouse vs Datamart
2. Slowly Changing Dimension
2. Star vs Snowflake schema
In the center is a fact table surrounded by a lot of dimension tables. Dimension tables are not normalized.
Ex: Dimension table patients will have physical address, city, state name and country columns
Snowflake is an extension of Star schema, where Dimension tables are normalized.
Ex: Dimension table patients will have only zip code. We will have another table from which we can calculate the address.
3. Functional Programming
Declarative type of programming. It's main focus is on what to solve instead of how to solve
Pure functions - functions with no side effects
Avoiding mutable data
Recursion
Functions are first class and can be of higher order
